        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>When Azrael Myers arrives at his college dorm to begin his freshman year studying Osteopathic Medicine, he's surprised to find he has a roommate—Biene Demetros, a quirky Naturopathic Medicine student with a penchant for beekeeping-inspired fashion. Their initial awkward meeting evolves into a strong partnership when they discover a mysterious infection spreading across campus, turning students into plant-like zombies.
          After their friend Jasper falls victim to the strange disease, Biene and Azrael uncover that Nurse Nightingale is behind the outbreak. Armed with their unique abilities—Biene's Botanokinesis allowing her to control plants and Azrael's Mortokinesis giving him power over death—they confront the nurse and discover a sinister plot that threatens the entire student body.
          As skeptical campus security slowly realizes the severity of the situation, Biene and Azrael take matters into their own hands, working tirelessly in a makeshift lab to develop a cure. Their solution—an aerosol treatment dispersed through the campus ventilation system—successfully counters the infection, saving countless lives.
          Four years later, at their graduation ceremony, the pair reflects on their extraordinary journey from reluctant roommates to campus heroes. Though the plant zombie incident has faded into campus legend, the experience has forged an unbreakable bond between them, preparing them for whatever challenges await in their medical careers.</p></section>
