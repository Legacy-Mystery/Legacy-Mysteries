        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p><strong>Biene, Azrael, and Amelia</strong> never expected their routine lives to be shattered by an ancient conspiracy. When a series of unnatural attacks lead them to a long-forgotten ruin, they uncover more than just history—secrets of a buried war, the name of a fallen god, and a power that refuses to stay sealed.

          As they delve deeper into the mystery, the trio braves deadly traps and relentless hunters, finally retrieving Draconyx’s lost staff—an artifact tied to a failed rebellion and a goddess who may still be pulling the strings. Forced to flee their home, they seek refuge in Crimson Hollow, only to find themselves branded criminals for carrying an unregistered dark magic relic. Their salvation comes in the form of an unlikely ally—someone who knows more than they should and may have their own stake in this unfolding battle.

          With the forces of Ethyros and Typhora closing in, the trio—and their newest companion—must decide: will they continue running, or will they fight to uncover the truth before history repeats itself?</p>
